= TERM development tool

This tool will parse openEHR terminology files located on /computable/XML folders and will generate:
* XML v3 files that combines all languages in one single file
* Asciidoctor files to be integrated with the other spec adoc files
* FHIR CodeSystem and ValueSet files based on discovered terminology vocabulary

== Usage

First you will need to change directory to `development`.
Docker-compose will be used to create a container with PHP code that will perform all necessary tasks.
The sequence of commands should normally be:
```
cd development
docker-compose run --rm php composer install
docker-compose run --rm php composer exec generate_all
```

An alternative is to use the provided wrapper bash script. To get the help on this command you will need to execute:
```
./run
```

== Output

Files are generated in `computable` and `docs/SupportTerminology/codesets` directory.
